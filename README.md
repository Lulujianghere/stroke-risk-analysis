# Stroke Risk Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores stroke occurrences using a real-world healthcare dataset to identify key risk factors such as **age, hypertension, glucose levels,** and their impact on stroke probability. Through **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**, we extract meaningful insights to better understand stroke risks.

**Dataset Source:** Kaggle - [Stroke Prediction Dataset by Fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
